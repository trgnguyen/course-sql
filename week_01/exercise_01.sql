-- us_cities CTE: The cities in the City table have been deduplicated by using qualify row_number=1
-- customer_location CTE: These are the customers who are eligible to order. Out of 10K customers, 2,401 customers are eligible to order from Virtual Kitchen. An inner join was performed between the Customer table with the City table to retrieve the geo_location information 
-- supplier_location CTE: An inner join was performed between the Supplier table with the City table to retrieve the geo_location information
-- closest_distance_to_supplier CTE: A cross join was performed between the Customer table and the Supplier table to calculate the distance. We then set row_number=1 to choose the closest distance between the customers and the supplier
-- final transformation: A simple join to get  our customer data, to order the results by the customerâ€™s last name and first name, and to have the table in the final format
